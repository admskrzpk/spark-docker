* Add path to folder as a command line argument  to the app which contains files (or hardcoded one) to display

* Build project using sbt Docker
[source,text]
----
sbt docker

Make sure that your project does not contain outdated project files using:
[source, text]
----
sbt clean

Make sure that correct dependencies are added to your build.sbt file:

[source,text]
